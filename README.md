This my first portfolio website developed using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for responsive. Live Preview : https://saahasportfolio.onrender.com/
If you visit the website you can see that the color combination used by me is the same as the logo color of the technologies that I have learned.
For color code you can visit this website : https://colorswall.com/ or just you can search "specific logo name color code" and visit the first website.
